# crisp-narrow
Ghost theme built on crisp and other bits

Mostly based on [kathyqian/crisp](https://github.com/kathyqian/crisp) with bits and pieces changed and played with. Used on my personal blog: https://rdrn.me/

Compatible with Ghost v2.2+

Uses Social Icons from [here](http://www.socicon.com/chart.php)
And stylistic cues from [gergelyorosz/GhostSocialCasper](https://github.com/gergelyorosz/GhostSocialCasper)
